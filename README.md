### Description of Application

This is a website for Jungle Cook.
The application allows the user to log into the site to access their saved recipes, or if they haven't signed up yet, it lets the user sign up.
The user has the ability to create new recipes, edit old ones, and delete those that they no longer want.
The navigation bar allows the user to easily move between pages, and the site is dynamic, so it is also possible to access the navigation when using a smaller screen.
Firebase allows the data inputed by the user is remembered and will still be there when they log back in.
In div#app there are some comments on unsolved issues.
